# Intellectual Property

> Sarah Pearson

## Goal

- Think beyond, and outside, of conventional wisdom around IP

## Points

1. IP (i.e. control) isn't as important as you think
1. IP isn't as scary as you think

## Copyright vs Trademarks vs Patents

- Copyrights are automatic, last the longest
- Designed to promote sharing and progression in sciences and arts

## Thoughts on control

- Complete control is impossible
- You can either fight it or embrace it
- The "sharing economy" has butterfly effects
  - Even sharing via commercial entities
  - Helps build a community
- The real value isn't always in the content
  - Remember, your value is your service (or thing(s))

## How do I implement this in practice?

- Design of products and services matter.
  - Lessig: Code is law
- Figure out what you're not depending on, and let it go
  - Let users own _their_ content
  - Consider CC licenses

## Fair Use

- purpose and character of work
- natue of work
- amount used
- impact on market of work
