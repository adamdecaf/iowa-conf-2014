## Words of wisdom

- There are so many good ideas.
  - That doesn't make a good product
    - Let alone a good company
- There's lots of people with money
  - Won't always make a good product

## What makes a good product?

    - Solves __the customer's__ problem
  - Delivers value
    - Delivers value over time, for a long time
  - Reasonable price
  - Readily available

- For the entrepreneur
  - Provides good margin
  - Easy to produce / deliver
  - Defensible in the market
  - Provides leverage
  - Ability to scale
  - Easy to identify / engage customer
  - High barrier to exit

## Idea to product?

- Test the __purchase process__, not the idea
- Understand the distribution channel costs
- Be brutally honest on how defensible your product is
- Can you afford to bring the product to market?
- Who are your first five customers by name?
  - When will they buy?

## Competition

- Some competition is good
  - Actually required
  - Remember the Pontiac Aztec?
- No competition is bad, horrible
  - Explain the iPhone without another phone to compare to

## Last Slide

- Your opinion in your product, company, brand, none of it matters
- There's no "I" in entrepreneur, product, company
- The letter "I" only appears in the word "idea"
  - I think, I believe, I like, I want, I feel
